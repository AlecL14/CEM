## Project Overview
We are building a centralised event management system where students and staff at RMIT can view all upcoming events from all the different clubs we have. The reason for this is that there is currently no way to view the events of clubs without being in the club itself, and no way to view a combined list of events from the different clubs. 

We will achieve this by creating a web app (with intentions of extending to mobile) where authorised admins of each club can post their events through our provided dashboard, where our system will be able to send emails, post on social media and post announcements in discord for them.  Should the club not wish to utilise our dashboard themselves, we will be able to scrape their announcements from their desired posting location, and add it to our event hub ourselves.
